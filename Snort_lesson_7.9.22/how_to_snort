Open Wireshark
run scan on target IP
save scan as .pcap tmpdump file
run your snort command with the captured file
EX: snort -k none -l ./logs/ -c ./fullstack.rules -r ./udp_undetected.pcap
-l creates a log file
-c is your rules file
-r is your packet cap file
With this file the I would not get any alerts unless I specifially run a UDP scan.
